The Skeleton and ghost can equip all weapons & armor except Hoods and Padded Helmet.

For the weapons SkeletonAxeIron, SkeletonSwordBronze, SkeletonSwordIron, SkeletonSwordSilver, SkeletonSwordSilverPoison, SkeletonSwordBlackMetal
in order for these to function, they must be set with a specific animation for example SkeletonSwordBronze@swing_longsword0 or SkeletonSwordBronze@jump_attack

if you want your skeleton to do multiple animations with the same weapon type you could give him all weapons
SkeletonSwordBronze@swing_longsword0
SkeletonSwordBronze@swing_longsword1
SkeletonSwordBronze@swing_longsword2
