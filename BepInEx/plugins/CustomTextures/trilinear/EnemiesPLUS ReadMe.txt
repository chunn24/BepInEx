Creeping the Steam forums of Valheim showed me at least one thing, PEOPLE WANT IMPROVED TEXTURES in Valheim. This mod aims to upgrade
the Enemy vanilla textures to higher res versions. While I did attempt to stay true to the devs
design of each texture, I did take some artistic liberties. This mod is a work in progress, and I will do more as
I find time/motivation. Certain monsters may appear unfinshed or have glaring flaws, I am aware and will get to them eventually.

Each monsters textures have been upscaled to 1024x1024 or 2048x2048 and repainted from 256x256/128x128 and also include the normals.
